==========

Force graph of relationships between developers and the teams they work with.

Warning there is no feedback for when data is being loaded so be patient :P, double click a name to add their data to the graph.

[DEMO](http://data.dino.io/developers) 

`Brad Muir` is a good place to start

1. Add loading bar
2. Extend beyond developers
